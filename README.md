# BoxStats
BoxStats is data visualization tool that shows a quick recent-fight snapshot and a more detailed career-chart of each of the top fighters in the world of boxing today.

## Functionality
- Fighter names are listed on the left-hand side in a scrollable module.
- Each fighter name is a clickable link that renders that fighters info on the current page upon a click.
- Individual fighter info. includes: the fighter's photo;
- a mini diagram showing that fighter's stats for his most recent fight (%punches landed, %power punches landed, #of knockdowns achieved);
- as well as a more detailed chart showing such fighter's career W/L%; ; K.O.%; #belts won; #divisions won; etc. The wireframe just below shows a basic visualization of this format.
